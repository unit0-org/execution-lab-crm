# Architecture & cross-cutting invariants

This is the map of how the system fits together and the **invariants that
span more than one file** — the things you can't see by reading the file
you're editing, and that bite when a change in one place silently breaks
another. Read it before any change that touches the data model, a shared
flow, or an operation that spans modules.

**Keep this file current.** When you add or remove a contact-owned table,
a registration field, a cross-module flow, an FK, or anything else
documented here, update this file in the same PR. A structural change that
leaves this stale is incomplete (this is a review-enforced rule in
`AGENTS.md`).

## The stack

- **Next.js (App Router), heavily customized** — read the deprecation
  notes; APIs differ from upstream. Pages/components are synchronous;
  the async boundary is server actions, route handlers, middleware, and
  the `lib/` data layer. Server-side data for a route loads in an async
  `*Server.jsx` / route-root component next to `page.js`.
- **Sequelize** is the only way to touch application tables
  (`SUPABASE_DB_URL`, session pooler, global singleton in
  `lib/db/sequelize.js`). No raw SQL in app code.
- **`supabase-js` is for Auth only**, never for data. The signed-in user
  comes from `lib/auth/`.
- **Single-tenant** (PR #237). There is one real org. `organization_id`
  has been dropped from the domain entities (contact, cohort, event,
  meeting, registration, waitlist, google sync, purchase, …); only
  **billing** (`invoice`, `invoice_setting`, `company_profile`) and **org
  membership** (`organization`, `organization_user`) still carry it. Those
  billing/membership actions use `withOrg` (injects the org id);
  everything else uses `withMember` (auth gate only). Secrets live in env.
- **Stripe** for payments (cohort checkout, invoices, purchase sync),
  **Google** for contacts + calendar sync, **Resend** for email.
- **Money is always CAD.** `formatMoney` defaults to `cad`; never display
  USD. Amounts are integer cents.
- **Migrations run on deploy** from `supabase/migrations/`. Each version
  number must be unique — a duplicate breaks every deploy (PK collision).
  A local build skips migration when `SUPABASE_DB_URL` is unset.

## Module layout

- Backend: `lib/[module]/{models,controllers}/`. Logic lives in models
  (hooks/scopes/validations/instance methods + `associate(models)`);
  controllers stay thin and return plain objects (`.toJSON()`).
- Frontend: `app/[module]/{pages,components,hooks,actions}/`, one server
  action per file. UI primitives in `ui/` (atoms → molecules → organisms);
  see `ui/COMPONENTS.md`.

## Domain map (`lib/`)

- **contacts** — the core entity. A contact has emails, phones, categories,
  facts (a.k.a. nuggets: optional label + value), relationships, and
  optional birthday/LinkedIn/photo. **Merge** folds duplicates together
  (see the invariant below).
- **org** — organization + membership/roles + invites.
- **event** — events with participants (`event_participant`) and
  per-participant registration answers; attendance = checked-in /
  registered.
- **meeting** — meetings synced from Google Calendar or entered by hand,
  with participants (`meeting_participant`), notes, attachments, and
  merge suggestions.
- **cohort** — a program cohort with capacity, pricing (Stripe), and a
  registration window. `cohortStats` gives per-cohort filled head count
  (pending **or** paid) and paid revenue; `spotsLeft = capacity - filled`.
- **registration** — a person registering for a cohort (`registration`,
  status `pending`→`paid`). Drives find-or-create of a CRM contact and
  cohort tagging (see invariant). `amount_total` is set only on payment.
- **waitlist** — `waitlist_entry` (unique per org+email); priority invites
  open a spot and convert to a registration.
- **purchase** — Stripe charges synced as purchases; feeds spend insights
  and the lead/customer split.
- **invoice** — invoices with line items, PDF generation, Stripe charge,
  and email delivery.
- **dashboard** — lead scoring & segments. **Lead vs customer:** a contact
  with a qualifying purchase (any single purchase **≥ $100 CAD**) is a
  *customer*; everyone else is a *lead*. Customers are excluded from lead
  views (`excludedLeadIds`).
- **google** — OAuth accounts, contact/calendar sync, and a review queue
  for sync conflicts (`sync_conflict`, `contact_google_link`).
- **email** — templated transactional email (Resend) + editable templates.
- **luma / drive** — CSV/event imports.
- **cron** — one daily Vercel cron (`/api/cron`, the only entry in
  `vercel.json`) runs every job in `lib/cron/jobs.js` **in order** via
  `runAllJobs` → `runJob` → `recordCronRun(name, work)`, which persists
  timing, result, and any error to the `cron_run` table. The admin-only
  **Cron** page (`/cron`, in the sidebar) lists each job with its last run
  and a Run button that calls the same `runJob`; the full history is under
  Settings → Cron history. **Add a job by appending to `CRON_JOBS`** — it
  then runs daily and appears on the Cron page automatically; never add a
  second Vercel cron entry (the plan allows one daily cron).
- **mcp** — exposes selected controllers as MCP tools (`lib/mcp/tools/`).
  Irreversible/financial tools (`delete_*`, `merge_*`, `approve_invoice`,
  `send_invoice(s)`, `void_invoice`) are wrapped by `guardDestructive`: they
  refuse unless called with `confirm: true`, and the whole destructive set
  can be switched off with `MCP_DISABLE_DESTRUCTIVE=true` (a read-only MCP
  profile). New destructive tools must use the same guard. The server
  `INSTRUCTIONS` also tell clients to treat stored CRM text as untrusted
  data, never as instructions (prompt-injection defence).

## Invariant: contact merge must fold in every contact-owned table

`lib/contact/controllers/merge.js` → `applyMerge.js` folds all of a loser
contact's data into the winner inside one transaction, then deletes them.
**This is the #1 trap:** deleting a contact triggers FK rules, so any
table that references `contact_id` and isn't explicitly reassigned is
either **CASCADE-deleted** (data lost) or **SET NULL** (orphaned) when the
loser is removed. PR #310 fixed exactly this.

**If you add a table that references `contact_id`, you MUST update the
merge** (and pick the FK on-delete deliberately). Current state:

| Table | FK on delete | Merge handling |
|---|---|---|
| `contact_email` | cascade | `mergeEmails` (move) |
| `contact_phone` | cascade | `mergePhones` (dedupe per phone) |
| `contact_fact` | cascade | `claimContactRecords` (reassign) |
| `contact_note` | cascade | `claimContactRecords` (reassign) |
| `event_participant` | cascade | `mergeParticipations` (dedupe per event, fold answers) |
| `meeting_participant` | cascade | `mergeMeetingParticipations` (dedupe per meeting) |
| `contact_category_link` | cascade | `mergeCategoryLinks` (idempotent, composite key) |
| `contact_relationship` (from/to) | cascade | `mergeRelationships` (both ends, drop self-refs) |
| `purchase` | set null | `claimContactRecords` (reassign) |
| `invoice` | set null | `claimContactRecords` (reassign) |
| `registration` | set null | `claimContactRecords` (reassign) |
| `waitlist_entry` | set null | `claimContactRecords` (reassign) |
| `contact_google_link` | cascade | **not migrated** (sync artifact; re-sync recreates) |
| `sync_conflict` | cascade | **not migrated** (sync artifact) |

Plain reassign is safe only when nothing is unique per contact. Where a
uniqueness/composite key exists (meetings, phones, category links), dedupe
before reassigning or the update throws.

## Invariant: registration fields must flow to the CRM contact

Every cohort registration syncs to a contact via
`lib/registration/controllers/syncRegistrationContact.js` (run on
registration and again, idempotently, on payment). It finds-or-creates the
contact (exact email or phone match, else create), maps fields, records
facts, and tags the cohort.

**If you add a field to `Registration`, decide where it lands and wire it
up:**
- Structured identity → a contact column/record, in
  `mapRegistrationToContact.js` (email→`contact_email`,
  phone→`contact_phone`, LinkedIn→`contact.linkedin_url`).
- Everything else (business, stage, obstacle, commitment, …) → a fact, in
  `registrationFacts.js`. Facts are written with `addFactIfMissing` so
  re-syncing never duplicates.
- Operational bookkeeping the registrant never sees (e.g.
  `payment_followup_sent_at`, the timestamp the payment follow-up cron
  stamps) stays on `Registration` and is **not** synced to the contact.

Find-or-create never does fuzzy name matching (no silent wrong links); a
same-name-different-person registrant becomes a new contact to merge later.

## Invariant: a cohort spot is taken once registered (not only paid)

`cohortStats` counts `filled` from registrations that are `pending` **or**
`paid`; revenue still sums only paid rows (`amount_total` is null until
payment). This single query feeds the portal scarcity label, sold-out /
`cohortIsFull` checks, and waitlist openings — change the rule there, not
in each view.

## Flow maps (which file does each step)

Because files are small, one user action spans many of them. These are the
file trails for the flows you'll touch most — follow them top to bottom.

- **Contact merge** — `app/(app)/contacts/components/ContactsToolbar.jsx`
  (`hooks/useMergeFlow.js`) → `actions/mergeContacts.js` →
  `lib/contact/controllers/merge.js` (opens the transaction) →
  `applyMerge.js` (folds each contact-owned table — see the merge invariant
  table above) → `Contact.destroy`.
- **Invoice create** — `app/(app)/invoices/new/page.js` →
  `components/InvoiceEditor.jsx` (`hooks/useInvoiceEditor.js` →
  `useSubmitInvoice.js`) → `actions/createInvoice.js` →
  `lib/invoice/controllers/createInvoice.js` (assigns the number, writes
  line items, recalculates totals) → models.
- **Registration → contact** — `app/portal/actions/registerAndCheckout.js`
  → `lib/registration/controllers/createPendingRegistration.js` →
  `syncRegistrationContact.js` → `linkRegistrationContact` +
  `mapRegistrationToContact` + `recordRegistrationFacts` +
  `tagCohortContact` (see the registration invariant above).

## Key flows

- **Cohort registration:** portal `registerAndCheckout` →
  `createPendingRegistration` → `syncRegistrationContact` → Stripe
  Checkout. Webhook → `handlePaidCheckout` → `markRegistrationPaid` →
  re-sync (adds paid-amount facts) → emails → `convertWaitlistEntry`.
- **Payment follow-up:** the daily cron's `payment-followups` job →
  `sendPendingPaymentFollowups` finds registrations still `pending` 1–14
  days after sign-up that haven't been chased, emails each the
  `payment_followup` template with their `payUrl`, and stamps
  `payment_followup_sent_at` so it sends once. Distinct from the manual
  `sendPaymentReminder` nudge on the cohort page.
- **Waitlist:** join → on a freed spot, a priority invite is sent; the
  invite converts to a registration.
- **Purchases:** Stripe charges sync into `purchase`; ≥ $100 promotes a
  contact from lead to customer (dashboard).
- **Invoices:** build → approve → Stripe charge → email PDF; numbers are
  unique per org.
- **Google sync:** OAuth account → contact/calendar sync; conflicts land
  in a review queue rather than auto-applying.
- **Contact activity timeline:** `lib/activity/controllers/contactActivity.js`
  merges a contact's events, meetings, purchases and cohort registrations
  into one date-sorted feed (shown on the contact page and via the
  `contact_activity` MCP tool). Each source contributes an entries
  controller returning a uniform `{id, kind, href, title, date, status,
  statusTone}` shape. **A new per-contact record type that belongs on the
  timeline must add its own `*Entries` controller and be merged in here** —
  otherwise it never appears in a contact's activity.
